# Valentine
Gen Z loves "receipts" (proof of history). We aren't building a boring card; we are building a scrollable data visualization of their relationship, wrapped in a "Coquette" (bows, soft pinks) x "Y2K" (pixel art, retro windows) aesthetic.  The Hook: "Send your partner their Relationship Receipt."
